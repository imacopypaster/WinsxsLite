-------------------------Overview and phases-----------------------------<BR>
</B>
<BR>
WinsxsLite is meant as a tool to help reduce the size of winsxs in Vista.<BR>
<BR>
WinsxsLite is split into two phases.<BR>
The first phase searches the Program Files and Windows folders for files,<BR>
that are exactly identical to files in the winsxs folder.<BR>
<BR>
The second phase replaces all the old versions of each file in winsxs,<BR>
with hardlinks to the highest version file.<BR>
So, it will still seem like there's, say, 16 different versions of a<BR>
particular file, but in reality, there's only one data object pointed to<BR>
by 16 directory entries.<BR>
Additionally, unused localized files can be eliminated, by replacing them<BR>
with hardlinks to the corresponding files in other languages.<BR>
<BR>
Note: Both phases are optional.<BR>
<BR>
Note: If Vista SP1 is installed, make sure vsp1cln.exe has been run.<BR>
<BR>
<B>
-------------------------Scan and apply----------------------------------<BR>
</B>
<BR>
Each phase is split in two.<BR>
The scan generates a ToDo list of files that should be replaced.<BR>
After that, selecting apply will perform the changes described in the<BR>
ToDo file.<BR>
<BR>
The apply option behaves differently, depending on whether the changes<BR>
are to be made to an online system partition, or an offline one.<BR>
Typically, WinsxsLite is asked to modify the current, running system.<BR>
<BR>
In that case (online), the apply function changes as much as it can,<BR>
and schedules the remaining in-use files to be replaced at reboot.<BR>
It's important that the system is rebooted when requested.<BR>
So, a typical online-system session would look like this:<BR>
Phase 1 scan<BR>
Phase 1 apply<BR>
Reboot<BR>
Phase 2 scan<BR>
Phase 2 apply<BR>
Reboot<BR>
<BR>
It's easier in a multiboot system, where one can boot the second Vista,<BR>
and then modify the first one.<BR>
A typical offline-system session would look like this:<BR>
Phase 1 scan<BR>
Phase 1 apply<BR>
Phase 2 scan<BR>
Phase 2 apply<BR>
<BR>
No in-use files means no reboots.<BR>
<BR>
Note: Beware of outdated scans!<BR>
      If the system is modified after a scan, that scan should be considered<BR>
      outdated, and a rescan should be performed before applying.<BR>
      Applying an outdated scan may corrupt the system.<BR>
<BR>
Note: If apply is operating in online mode, a few hardlinks may linger in<BR>
      the temporary C:\$ directory (if root=C:), even after a reboot.<BR>
      this is because a few system files get locked before pending file<BR>
      operations are performed during reboot.<BR>
      Running WinsxsLite again will then present the option to reschedule<BR>
      these files. Rescheduling also "shuffles" the files in each hardlink<BR>
      group, in an attempt to cure this problem.<BR>
      Sometimes, rescheduling may even save one from having to do the post-<BR>
      apply reboot in the first place.<BR>
<BR>
      A related problem is the failure to delete a few obsolete hardlinks<BR>
      in C:\$, even during a reboot. This is because Vista mistakenly thinks<BR>
      they are locked, when in reality, it's the files they are linking to,<BR>
      that are locked. The only way to get rid of these hardlinks, is to put<BR>
      the partition offline and delete them manually.<BR>
<BR>
Note: Some functions, like the apply function, works under Windows XP.<BR>
<BR>
<B>
-------------------------Relocate folders--------------------------------<BR>
</B>
<BR>
This, the 3rd phase, takes care of data that is never used,<BR>
or almost never used.<BR>
<BR>
There's no reason to keep more than a gigabyte of drivers on the system<BR>
drive - particularly if it's a high performance SSD.<BR>
The same goes for install packages left by certain software.<BR>
Those will only be used again, if the software is ever uninstalled.<BR>
<BR>
See below for config options.<BR>
<BR>
<B>
-------------------------Auto start--------------------------------------<BR>
</B>
<BR>
This function schedules WinsxsLite to run automatically on the next reboot.<BR>
<BR>
It's very useful, because it runs before everything else, including logon.<BR>
This means fewer files are locked, thus fewer 'access denied' issues.<BR>
<BR>
The folder relocate function will activate auto start if errors occurred<BR>
during copies, and the user chose 'Complete on reboot'.<BR>
<BR>
<B>
-------------------------Configuration-----------------------------------<BR>
</B>
<BR>
The first time WinsxsLite is run, it creates an example configuration file.<BR>
Close WinsxsLite, and review Config.txt to make sure it fits your needs.<BR>
<BR>
Note: Config.txt is only parsed once - during program startup.<BR>
      So, restart WinsxsLite for changes in Config.txt to take effect.<BR>
<BR>
<B>
The first section of the default Config.txt starts like this:<BR>
</B>
<BR>
:PHASE 1 EXCLUDES<BR>
\desktop.ini/<BR>
\system.ini/<BR>
.log/<BR>
.etl/<BR>
.tmp/<BR>
.nt/<BR>
.config/<BR>
\NTUSER.DAT<BR>
\usrclass.dat<BR>
$winsxs$\InstallTemp\<BR>
$winsxs$\ManifestCache\<BR>
<BR>
 (...)<BR>
<BR>
This tells phase 1 that certain files shouldn't be considered for replacement.<BR>
The strings are matched against full paths, so specifying:<BR>
\System32\DriverStore\<BR>
- would exclude all files in that directory.<BR>
The optional forward slash, that can be put at the end of a line, means<BR>
only-match-against-end-of-full-path.<BR>
$root$, $win$, $winsxs$ and $system32$ expands to the the various windows<BR>
folder paths (like C: , C:\Windows and so on).<BR>
<BR>
Note: $Phase1Extensions.txt is generated as additional help to see what's<BR>
      going on. It contains almost the same information as ToDo1.txt,<BR>
      but sorted according to extensions.<BR>
<BR>
Note: Setting ':PROGRAM FILES DIR=' causes program files to be omitted<BR>
      during phase 1.<BR>
<BR>
<B>
The second section looks like this:<BR>
</B>
<BR>
:PHASE 2 LANGUAGE PRIORITIES<BR>
en-us=KEEP<BR>
en-gb<BR>
da-dk=KEEP<BR>
sv-se<BR>
nb-no<BR>
de-de<BR>
<BR>
This example defines six prioritized base languages - English-US,English-GB,<BR>
Danish,Swedish,Bokmaal-Norwegian and German.<BR>
English-US and Danish are marked as languages to KEEP.<BR>
Thus, after running phase 2, all localized files, except Danish, will have<BR>
been replaced with hardlinks to English-US.<BR>
<BR>
Why not just:<BR>
<BR>
:PHASE 2 LANGUAGE PRIORITIES<BR>
en-us=KEEP<BR>
da-dk=KEEP<BR>
<BR>
Under most circumstances, this would yield exactly the same results, except if<BR>
English-US and Danish versions of some files are absent. In that case, it<BR>
matters which language is down next on the list.<BR>
<BR>
Leaving this section empty - that is, not defining any base languages,<BR>
will obviously cause all languages to be left alone during phase 2.<BR>
<BR>
Note: After a phase 2 scan, the help file $LanguageStrings.txt contains all<BR>
      the different language strings found in winsxs during the scan.<BR>
      The second part of a language string denotes the country.<BR>
      A list of two-character country codes can be found here:<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.theodora.com/country_digraphs.html">http://www.theodora.com/country_digraphs.html</A><BR>
      - and language codes:<BR>
<A HREF="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms533052(VS.85).aspx">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms533052(VS.85).aspx</A><BR>
<BR>
<B>
The last section:<BR>
</B>
<BR>
:RELOCATE FOLDERS=D:\<BR>
$system32$\DriverStore\FileRepository<BR>
$system32$\DriverStore\Temp<BR>
$win$\Installer<BR>
<BR>
These defaults define the folder relocate target path to be the D: drive.<BR>
It then specifies the folders to be moved.<BR>
Note that the $system32$\DriverStore\en-US folder is omitted on purpose.<BR>
It only contains hardlinks, that would turn into objects, if moved to D:<BR>
<BR>
Generally, avoid 'breaking' hardlinks, since the only result is wasted space<BR>
on the target drive. After running phase 1 and 2 on a fresh Vista install,<BR>
the \Program Files folder takes up around 10MB. Relocate it, and the<BR>
broken hardlinks makes it balloon to 500MB.<BR>
Of course, some software can't be prevented from installing a lot of data in<BR>
\Program Files. If this becomes a problem, then just relocate that particular<BR>
software.<BR>
<BR>
Be careful - WinsxsLite will try to relocate anything you ask it to.<BR>
<BR>
<B>
-------------------------Winsxs size-------------------------------------<BR>
</B>
<BR>
This function reports the true size of the winsxs folder.<BR>
<BR>
Explorer doesn't do this. If one puts a single 1MB object with 10 directory<BR>
entries in the same folder, Explorer will report 10MB.<BR>
That 1MB should be the correct answer, is obvious.<BR>
But what if the 10 entries are scattered all over the directory tree ?<BR>
Where is that 1MB truly located ?<BR>
<BR>
That's why two numbers are calculated:<BR>
<BR>
The "unique" number, is the size of all objects that only have directory<BR>
entries in winsxs.<BR>
If one deleted the winsxs folder, this would be the number of bytes freed.<BR>
<BR>
The "shared" number, is the size of all objects that have entries in both<BR>
winsxs and in directories outside winsxs.<BR>
Thus, deleting winsxs won't free any of these bytes, since the objects are<BR>
still referenced from elsewhere. A filesystem object is only deallocated when<BR>
its reference count reaches zero.<BR>
<BR>
Adding these two numbers together, one gets the total amount of bytes<BR>
referenced from within winsxs.<BR>
This isn't the number Explorer reports, because some objects are referenced<BR>
more than once from within winsxs - and Explorer counts each reference.<BR>
<BR>
The results for the main subdirectories in winsxs are listed as well, and put<BR>
in the log too.<BR>
<BR>
The bad news, is that this operation takes about 10 minutes to complete.<BR>
<BR>
<B>
-------------------------3rd party software------------------------------<BR>
</B>
<BR>
WinsxsLite makes use of certain pieces of third party software:<BR>
<BR>
SubInACL v5.2.3790.1180<BR>
From Microsoft<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=E8BA3E56-D8FE-4A91-93CF-ED6985E3927B&displaylang=en">http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=E8BA3E56-D8FE-4A91-93CF-ED6985E3927B&displaylang=en</A><BR>
Make sure SubInAcl.exe is put where WinsxsLite can find it.<BR>
